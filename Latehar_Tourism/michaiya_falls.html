        <strong>Mirchaiya Falls</strong> is a breathtaking waterfall located
        just 3 km from the Garu block in Latehar district, Jharkhand. Nestled
        within the <strong>Betla Tiger Project Reserve</strong>, this natural
        wonder offers a peaceful retreat into the heart of nature and is
        regarded as one of the safest waterfalls in the state.
      </p>

      <h2>Formation</h2>
      <p>
        The waterfall is formed by a tributary of the
        <strong>North Koel River</strong>. It flows over a striking black
        granite lava dome, creating a stunning cascade that gives the waterfall
        its unique look. This geological formation is part of ancient lava flows
        in the region.
      </p>

      <h2>Location and Wildlife</h2>
      <p>
        Located inside the Betla Tiger Reserve (declared a tiger reserve in
        1989), the area around Mirchaiya Falls is rich in wildlife. Visitors may
        spot <strong>tigers, elephants, deer, and various bird species</strong>,
        making it a must-visit destination for wildlife enthusiasts.
      </p>

      <h2>“Niagara Falls of Jharkhand”</h2>
      <p>
        Due to its majestic beauty and powerful water flow during monsoons,
        Mirchaiya Falls is fondly referred to as the
        <strong>“Niagara Falls of Jharkhand.”</strong> Its multi-tiered cascades
        over rocky steps make it a favorite among photographers and nature
        lovers.
      </p>

      <h2>Accessibility and Tourism</h2>
      <p>
        The waterfall is just 50 meters from the
        <strong>Garu-Netarhat road</strong>, making it easily accessible by
        foot. The site includes
        <strong>clean toilets, wooden stairs, and entry management</strong>.
        Accommodations and food services are available in Garu town.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Monsoon season (June to September)
