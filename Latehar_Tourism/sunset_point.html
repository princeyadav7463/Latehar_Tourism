      <h2>Colonial History & Significance</h2>
      <p>
        During British rule, Netarhat was developed as a summer retreat due to
        its cool climate and hilly terrain. British officers, including
        Lieutenant-Governor Sir Edward Gait, are credited with popularizing this
        region. Infrastructure, such as roads and guest houses, were developed
        during this time, making Netarhat accessible and welcoming to travelers.
