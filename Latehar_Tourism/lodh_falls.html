        The Lodh Falls, also known locally as <strong>Budha Ghagh</strong>, is
        the tallest waterfall in the state of Jharkhand and the 21st highest in
        India. Nestled deep within the forests of the
        <strong>Palamau Tiger Reserve</strong>, the falls are located on the
        <strong>Burha River</strong> in the Latehar district, part of the Chota
        Nagpur Plateau.
      </p>

      <p>
        This magnificent waterfall stands at a height of
        <strong>143 meters (469 feet)</strong> and is a prime example of a
        <em>tiered waterfall</em> with multiple distinct drops occurring in
        close succession. The thunderous sound of the falling water can be heard
        from as far as 10 km away, adding to the mystique and power of the
        falls.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Lodh Falls is also a notable geographical feature known as a
        <strong>nick point</strong>‚Äîa break in the slope of a river‚Äôs
        longitudinal profile caused by rejuvenation. These knick points cause
        the water to drop suddenly, creating the dramatic visual spectacle of a
        waterfall.
      </p>

      <p>
        Surrounded by thick forests, rich biodiversity, and serene natural
        beauty, Lodh Falls is not only a geographical marvel but also a haven
        for nature lovers, photographers, and adventurers seeking solitude and
        natural splendor.
