      <h1>Palamu Fort</h1>

        The old fort in the plains, which existed even before the Chero dynasty,
        was built by the King of Raksel Dynasty. However, it was during the
        reign of King Medini Ray (1658‚Äì1674), a Chero tribal king, that the fort
        was reconstructed into a strong defensive structure. His rule extended
        across South Gaya and Hazaribagh. After defeating the Nagvanshi Raja
        Raghunath Shah of Navratangarh, Medini Ray used the spoils to construct
        a lower fort near Satbarwa, which became historically significant.

        The Mughals, under Emperor Akbar, tried to conquer Palamu in 1574 led by
        Raja Man Singh, but his troops were eventually defeated by 1605. Later,
        under Jahangir, several invasions occurred due to the refusal of the
        Raksel rulers to pay tribute. In 1613, the Chero chief Bhagwant Rai took
        over Palamu with help from local allies, establishing Chero rule.

        On 3 April 1660, Daud Khan began his invasion. He demanded conversion of
        the Hindu population under the Chero rule, which was refused. After
        months of resistance, both Palamu forts were captured, temples were
        destroyed, and Islamic rule was imposed.

        After Medini Ray‚Äôs death, internal conflict and betrayal led to the
        dynasty's collapse. In 1771, Captain Camac of the British East India
        Company attacked the forts. Despite brave defense by the Chero soldiers,
        they were forced to abandon the New Fort. By 1772, the British had taken
        control. In 1882, Cheros and Kharwars rebelled again, but their uprising
        was suppressed.

        Today, the twin forts of Palamu remain a symbol of tribal bravery and
        resistance. Surrounded by Betla National Park, they attract history
        lovers and tourists from across India.
