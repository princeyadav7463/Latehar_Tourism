      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <p>
        Although Koel View Point does not have an extensively recorded history,
        its importance is closely linked to Netarhat's past. During British
        colonial times, Netarhat was developed as a summer hill station because
        of its cool, refreshing climate and its resemblance to the European
        highlands. The serene beauty of Koel View Point was one of the reasons
        the British established retreats and schools in the region.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, Koel View Point stands as a favorite among nature lovers,
        photographers, and tourists looking to soak in the untouched beauty of
        the region. The tranquil ambiance, forested hills, and river valley make
        it an ideal spot for peace and relaxation.
      </p>

      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>
        The viewpoint is located just about 3 km from the main Netarhat area and
        is easily accessible by road. It’s one of the must-visit spots when
        exploring Netarhat.
